## Key Achievements

- **Improved Classification Accuracy:**
  - Boosted accuracy to **92%** by integrating RetinaFace for precise face detection on a real-world dataset.
  
- **Dataset Creation & Augmentation:**
  - Developed a **high-resolution dataset with 200 classes** and employed advanced augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.

- **Model Comparison & Embeddings:**
  - Generated face embeddings using **FaceNet** and compared performance against models like **DeepFace, VGGFace, ArcFace**, and **OpenFace**.
  - Implemented **cosine similarity** for recognition, optimizing accuracy across models.

- **Efficiency & Processing Time:**
  - Reduced face detection time by **0.6 seconds** using OpenCV for image processing.
  - Utilized **Numpy** and **Pandas** for comprehensive data analysis and processing.
